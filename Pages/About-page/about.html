                    In the ancient realm of Codeoria, knowledge is not written
                    with ink or carved in stone it is woven from glowing Runes
                    of Creation. These runes form the very fabric of the webbed
                    worlds we walk upon. Few mortals understand their true
                    power‚Ä¶ and fewer still dare to wield them.
                    The art is called Rune Weaving.

                <p class="text-2xl text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto">With the
                    <strong>Runes of Structure (HTML)</strong>, a
                    Weaver lays the
                    foundation of reality. These runes form the bones of
                    kingdoms the walls of castles, the bridges of villages,
                    the very paths that lead adventurers onward.

                    With the <strong>Runes of Illusion (CSS)</strong>, a Weaver
                    paints beauty
                    upon the world. Colors shimmer, shadows dance, and forms
                    take shape in endless variations. Without these illusions,
                    realms are bare and lifeless.

                    flicker,
                    and enchanted relics respond to touch. This is the spark
                    that animates creation.

                    To master these three branches is to command the essence
                    of
                    Codeoria itself. But beware the land is plagued by Bugs,
                    chaotic spirits that twist runes into errors and
                    confusion.
                    Only a true Rune Weaver, brave and patient, can banish
                    them
                    and restore harmony to the Web of Worlds. <br>

                    Now, Apprentice, your journey begins in the gentle hills
                    of
                    HTMLia. Armed with courage and guided by wisdom, you
                    shall
                    climb the CSS Caves, brave the tangled Flexbox Forest,
                    and
                    chart the Grid Gardens. Each victory shall grant you
                    runes
                    of power, drawing you closer to becoming a Master Weaver
                    of
                    the Code. <br>

                    Will you rise, or will the Bugs consume the weave? The
                    choice is yours‚Ä¶

                    Every great adventure needs a hero, and in CodeQuest, that
                    hero is you. Whether you're a curious beginner eager to
                    learn the ropes of web development or an experienced coder
                    looking to sharpen your skills, CodeQuest is designed to
                    guide you on your journey.

                <p class="text-2xl text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                    In the realm of Codeoria, knowledge does not flow through
                    scrolls or tomes it flows through <strong>Runes of
                        Creation</strong>,
                    glowing symbols that pulse with raw magic. Only those
                    attuned to their rhythm can bend reality itself. This
                    ancient art is known as <strong>Rune Weaving</strong>, and
                    its mastery is rare.
                </p>
                <p class="text-2xl text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                    You, Apprentice, are unlike most mortals. From the moment
                    your hands first brushed the shimmering air of Codeoria, the
                    runes recognized you. Where others stumble, you sense the
                    harmony; where others falter, your fingers trace the
                    invisible threads that bind worlds together. You are one of
                    the few ‚Äî a <strong>Weaver of Runes</strong>, capable of
                    shaping reality from
                    pure thought and pattern.

                <p class="text-2xl text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                    Your magic begins humbly in <strong>HTML Hills</strong>,
                    where the first
                    Runes of Structure lie buried beneath gentle earth. Each tag
                    you weave is a stone in the foundation of kingdoms, each
                    element a spark of creation. As you lay headings,
                    paragraphs, and links, the land responds. Villages rise,
                    paths appear, and the very essence of Codeoria flows through
                    your fingertips.
                </p>
                <p class="text-2xl text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                    But mastery is not without peril. <strong>Bugs</strong>,
                    chaotic spirits born
                    of disorder, lurk in every shadow, twisting runes into
                    confusion. Only the vigilant and patient can banish them, or
                    risk seeing their creations crumble.

                    With every lesson, you do not simply learn ‚Äî you enchant.
                    Every heading, list, and image is a spell, every page a
                    tapestry of your power. Soon, HTML Hills will yield to your
                    command, and the next realms CSS Caves, Flexbox Forest,
                    and beyond will beckon, each more challenging, each more

                    Know this, Weaver: the path of Rune Weaving is not a journey

                    imagination, you do not merely follow the weave <strong>you

                    <strong>HTML Hills ‚ÄúThe Foundations of Creation‚Äù</strong>
                    The soft, rolling hills stretch before you, dotted with
                    half-formed villages and the skeletons of castles yet to
                    rise. Here, every tag you lay in the soil becomes a stone in
                    the edifice of reality. Apprentice, tread carefully ‚Äî one
                    miscast rune and the ground trembles beneath your feet. Your
                    first lessons in structure await, for only a stable
                    foundation can bear the wonders to come. <br>

                    <strong>CSS Caves ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Illusions of Light and
                        Shadow‚Äù</strong>
                    You descend into luminous caverns, walls shimmering with
                    shifting patterns. Shadows curl and colors dance at your
                    touch, yet illusions can deceive as easily as they enchant.
                    Here, you will learn to weave beauty and form from pure
                    perception. Shape the world as you wish, but beware the
                    lurking specters of clashing styles, ready to twist your
                    magic. <br>

                    <strong>Flexbox Forest ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Dance of Alignment‚Äù</strong>
                    Trees sway in patterns that seem to follow an unseen rhythm.
                    Branches twist and paths realign themselves as you pass.
                    Only a skilled Weaver can harmonize with this ever-shifting
                    woodland, guiding elements to their destined places. Step
                    lightly, Apprentice, and learn the secret dance that brings
                    order to chaos. <br>

                    <strong>Grid Gardens ‚ÄúThe Geometry of Harmony‚Äù</strong>
                    A serene expanse unfolds, rows of glowing flowers and
                    crystalline fountains forming intricate grids. Each
                    alignment hums with hidden power. Here, precision rules, and
                    balance is rewarded. Place each rune in its rightful cell,
                    and the gardens will bloom with energy ‚Äî neglect your duty,
                    and patterns collapse into disarray. <br>

                    <strong>Media Mountains ‚ÄúThe Voices of the World‚Äù</strong>
                    Rugged peaks pierce the sky, echoing with images, music, and
                    motion. Here, Weavers summon the senses, giving form to
                    sight and sound. Every mountain path carries a new
                    challenge: to control the media that shapes perception
                    itself. Only those who command these voices can call the
                    attention of the realm. <br>

                    <strong>Responsive River ‚ÄúThe Flow of Adaptation‚Äù</strong>
                    A luminous river winds unpredictably through valleys, rising
                    and falling with the moods of the land. Apprentice, here you
                    must learn to bend your runes to the flow, crafting magic
                    that adapts to every shore. Flexibility is your ally;
                    rigidity, your foe. Master the currents, and your power will
                    ripple across all of Codeoria.
